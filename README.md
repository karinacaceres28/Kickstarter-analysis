# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is a promising playwriter who is responsible for Fever, a play she was near successful in funding with a crowdfunding campaign budget of $10,000 in a short period of time. She is now interested in seeing the correlation of different campaigns between their launching dates and funding goals. With the data obtained, we were able to infer that the higher the outcome goals, the more likely they are to fail. It was also observed that campaigns are the most successful during the summer months, between May and August.
### Purpose
The purpose of obtaining this information was so that Louise could have a better understanding of when to set out her crowdfunding campaigns as well as what is a realistic budged for the fund.
## Analysis and Challenge:

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I observed that goals are more successful during the warmer months, the highest being in May, being 111. The successful line starts off having 56 in January. It then moves up to 71 in February, back down to 56 in March, back up to 71 in April. I then observe a steep increase, having the maximum of 111 in May. It remains high in June, with 110. It gradually goes down, having 87 in July, 72 in August, and September having 59. It then jumps up to 65 in October, going back down to 54 in November. It then it goes down steep to the minimum, 37, in December. This shows that the best time to set a campaign fund is in the warmer months, specifically May. The data for failed starts with 33 in January, 39 in February, back down to 33 in March, then 40 in April. It then gets to the max, 52, in May. It lowers to 49 in June, 50 in July, 47 in August, 34 in September, 50 in October, 31 in November, and 35 in December. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launched](path/to/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launched.png)
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I observed an inversion between percentage successful and percentage failed. I also found the lower the goal, the more successful the campaign. The data for percentage successful starts off with the maximum percent at 76%, with a gradual slope between goals less than $24,999. The slope than becomes steep aiming down to 45% for goals between $25,000 to $29,999. It then has a slight incline, then steeping up to 67% at goal campaigns $35,000 to $39,999 and showing no change until it steeps down to the minimum of 0% at $45,000 to $44,999. Although though it is shows to jump up to 67%, it will not go back up because the higher the goal, the lease likely it is on becoming successful. That also shows that the higher the goal rate is, the more likely it is that the campaign funding fails. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](path/to/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not face any challenges setting the values for the pivot table because I understood the goal of the image and what I was trying to observe, that being the outcome of goals based on the months/date of the launched dates. I do see the potential of challenge when creating the pivot table, such as which values to put on columns, rows, and values. One could have put different values on each set. I did face a challenge in the second set of data for the “Outcomes based on Goal.” I understood how to obtain number successful, failed, canceled, and total projects. I had difficulties in the percentage section of the data because when I plugged in the equation (specific number, dividing by total, multiplying by 100), it would make the percent a large number. I understood that the decimal place had to be moved twice, so in doing so I divided the whole equation by 100, giving me the correct set of values.
## Results
As discussed, it was observed that for “Outcomes Based on Launch Date,” it is wiser to set a campaign launch during warmer months, specifically in May. Another thing observed it that December had the lowest success set of outcomes, being that it was the minimum on the set. In the “Outcomes Based on Goals,” there is an inversion between percentage successful and percentage failed. The higher the goal is, the least likely the campaign is to succeed. The same could be said, if the goal is high than it is more likely to fail. There are some limitations because these sets of data are not specific to a country. I would like to see some graphs showing which theaters have the most successful and failed outcomes in specific countries.
